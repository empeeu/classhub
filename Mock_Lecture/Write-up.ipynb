      "The ClassHub website aims to improve education by freeing up an instructor's time to allow for more active learning. ClassHub does this by providing freely-available open source lecture material that can be distributed, edited, and collectively improved. The basic premise complements the concept of a 'flipped classroom,' where students are assigned to review the lecture material outside of the classroom, while problems are worked during class time. Without needing to spend time preparing lecture material, instructors will have a better opportunity to directly interact with students as they are applying newly learned material. Additionally, it also allows more time for an instructor to fairly evaluate a student's grasp of the materials. While ClassHub is designed for the flipped classroom, the lecture resources are also a time-saver for instructors in traditional classrooms. Finally, as this is an open framework, it allows the possibility for students to connect with professionals in academia and industry by solving real-world problems related to their learning. "

      "Education is broken. This is recognized by many. There are papers (find refs.) of psychological studies that show the way we teach engineering is the worst way for retention (i.e. learning). It has also been shown that testing and exams do not necessarily correlate with student performance in the workplace. Additionally, companies complain that new engineers don't know anything useful. \n",

But, I think this website is a viable tool toward solving the 'education-is-broken' problem. I think the problem is greater than a few people. Therefore, a tool that allows a lot of people to work together to solve the problem is needed. I don't think there is one break-through idea that will solve education. I think it's a lot of small ideas collected for all to benefit is the key. \n",

      "This idea is also not intended to remove the instructor completely from the learning process. Instead, it is meant to enhance the role of the instructor. Nowadays anyone can go online and look at a lecture for a specific topic (in case your instructor has terrible presentation skills). But, that static video does not allow the opportunity for someone to clarify ideas, or ask what-if questions. I do not believe that there will be a magic set of master lecture notes that will answer all the doubts of all the students. How people learn depends heavily on their backgrounds, personal experience, and way of thinking. However, I do think that there can be a universal set of notes, backed by researched, that can clear up the majority of common misconceptions. "

A master copy of the lecture is stored on the main ClassHub website, but there will also be 'forks' of this master lecture based on discipline, schools, institutions, instructors, and classes (Figure 4). Once a good starting version is identified, the lecturer forks the lecture to their personal account where they can make appropriate changes. Once they are happy with a master copy of their own, they fork their own version one more time for each new class. Their master copy, then, serves as a set of notes that can be re-used from one semester to the next.

During the course updates and corrections can still be made, but after the course is over, the notes associated with that class will remain unchanged and serve as a reference to students in the future.

To help with this step, a text-to-speech software program is used to automatically generate audio for the transcript. This generated audio could be used for the final lecture, however it is recommended that the lecturer re-read the transcript in their own voice for the student's benefit. In Figure 6, the green tags indicate presentation timings. The transcript, in a sense, acts as a timeline for the lecture. The timings between tags are interpolated from the result of the the text-to-speech software, and allow for a coarse adjustment. To finely control events, timing tags can be use just before or just after event tags. This is useful when a lecturer has recorded the transcript in their own voice, and need to adjust timings. Event tags can be inserted into the lecture, or adjusted from the events diaglogue, similar to PowerPoint presentations. \n",

The second type are usually more involved, and they can be addressed during the normal lecture time (as part of a flipped classroom), or left for the student as additional exercise.
