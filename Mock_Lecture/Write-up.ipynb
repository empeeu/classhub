      "The ClassHub website aims to improve education by freeing up an instructor's time to allow for more active learning. ClassHub does this by providing freely-available open source lecture material that can be distributed, edited, and collectively improved. The basic premise complements the concept of a 'flipped classroom,' where students are assigned to review the lecture material outside of the classroom, while problems are worked during class time. Without needing to spend time preparing lecture material, instructors will have a better opportunity to directly interact with students as they are applying newly learned material. Additionally, it also allows more time for an instructor to fairly evaluate a student's grasp of the materials. While ClassHub is designed for the flipped classroom, the lecture resources are also a time-saver for instructors in traditional classrooms. Finally, as this is an open framework, it allows the possibility for students to connect with professionals in academia and industry by solving real-world problems related to their learning. "

      "Education is broken. This is recognized by many. There are papers (find refs.) of psychological studies that show the way we teach engineering is the worst way for retention (i.e. learning). It has also been shown that testing and exams do not necessarily correlate with student performance in the workplace. Additionally, companies complain that new engineers don't know anything useful. \n",

      "Solving education is a big problem, but no one knows how to do it. We know the way we are teaching is wrong, but we don't know how to change it. I don't know how to change it either. But, I think this website is a viable tool toward solving the 'education-is-broken' problem. I think the problem is greater than a few people. Therefore, a tool that allows a lot of people to work together to solve the problem is needed. I don't think there is one break-through idea that will solve education. I think it's a lot of small ideas collected for all to benefit is the key. \n",
      "\n",
      "This idea is also not intended to remove the instructor completely from the learning process. Instead, it is meant to enhance the role of the instructor. Nowadays anyone can go online and look at a lecture for a specific topic (in case your instructor has terrible presentation skills). But, that static video does not allow the opportunity for someone to clarify ideas, or ask what-if questions. I do not believe that there will be a magic set of master lecture notes that will answer all the doubts of all the students. How people learn depends heavily on their backgrounds, personal experience, and way of thinking. However, I do think that there can be a universal set of notes, backed by researched, that can clear up the majority of common misconceptions. "
