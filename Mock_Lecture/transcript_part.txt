So I'm gonna have to somehow grasp this, and I'll first do it in language. And it's the following idea: it's that if you take this blue line, which is called a seecant line, and you think of the point Que as getting closer and closer to Pee, then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line. And if we draw it close enough, then that's gonna be the correct line. So that's really what I did, sort of in my brain when I drew that first line.

And so that's the way I'm going to articulate it first. Now, so the tangent line is equal to the limit of so-called seecant lines Pee Que, as Que tends to Pee. And here we're thinking of P as being fixed and Que as variable. All right? Again, this is still the geometric discussion, but now we're gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation. And we'll be able to work out formulas in any example.
